/*10. Implement a class Employee. An employee has a name (a string) and a salary (a
double). Provide a constructor with two arguments public Employee(String
employeeName, double currentSalary) and methods public String getName() public
double getSalary() public void raiseSalary(double byPercent) These methods return
the name and salary, and raise the employeeâ€™s salary by a certain percentage.
Sample usage: Employee harry = new Employee("Hacker, Harry", 50000);
harry.raiseSalary(10); // Harry gets a 10 percent raise Supply an EmployeeTester
class that tests all methods*/
